# Release format specification

**Format version: 1.** This file is the versioned schema artifact for release descriptors — shape
and validation rules only. It contains no process (how a release is proposed and reviewed is the
way of working) and no content (see `releases/`, one file per version). As with `claim-format.md`,
the three change independently.

**Versioning rules.** A format change bumps the format version and ships a migration note in this
file stating how existing descriptors move (or that they are valid unchanged). Descriptors declare
the format they conform to; validation is always against the declared version.

Storage: one YAML file per release under `releases/`, named for the version it declares —
`releases/v5.5.0.yaml`. The file **is** the release request. Adding one in a pull request is how a
release is proposed; merging it to the default branch is how the release is cut. There is no
second, out-of-band step, and no privileged local credential in the path.

## 1. Schema

```yaml
format: 1                    # spec version this descriptor conforms to; mandatory
version: v5.5.0              # v<major>.<minor>.<patch>; equals the filename stem; never reused
title: >                     # one line; the tag message is composed as "<version> — <title>",
                             # so the title carries no version prefix of its own
commit: e8663b8              # optional; the commit to tag. Omitted (the normal case) means
                             # "the commit that lands this file on the default branch", which
                             # is the only value a pull request cannot know about itself.
                             # Present pins an explicit earlier commit — a retro-cut.
date: 2026-08-16             # optional; when the release was prepared, not when it was cut
basis:                       # mandatory, non-empty; claim and decision IDs this release pins.
  - DDD-ground-01            # each must resolve to core/claims/ or core/decisions/
summary: >                   # mandatory; the release notes body, markdown, written not generated
draft: false                 # optional; create the GitHub Release as a draft
prerelease: false            # optional; mark the GitHub Release as a prerelease
```

## 2. Rules

1. **The version is the identity.** It matches `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, equals the filename
   stem, and is unique across `releases/`. Versions are never reused — the same rule claim IDs
   live under, for the same reason: a cut tag is a fact about history, not a name to recycle.
2. **The title carries no version prefix.** The tag message is composed as `<version> — <title>`
   with an em dash, matching `v5.0.0`..`v5.4.0`. A title beginning with its own version would
   double it.
3. **`commit` is optional, and omitting it is normal.** A pull request cannot know the SHA of its
   own merge, so the default is "wherever this file lands". Set it only to pin a release at an
   earlier commit, which CI requires be an ancestor of the default branch — a release must never
   pin canon the default branch does not carry.
4. **`basis` is mandatory and must resolve.** A release pins canon, so it cites the canon it pins.
   Every ID must name a file in `core/claims/` or `core/decisions/`. This is `DDD-agent-01`'s
   basis-as-query applied to releases: the citation is checked against the live repo, not taken on
   the confidence of the prose that proposes it.
5. **`summary` is mandatory.** Release notes are written and reviewed in the pull request, not
   generated from a commit range after the fact.
6. **Descriptors are immutable once cut.** A version whose tag exists is skipped, so editing its
   file changes nothing about the release. Corrections ship as a new version, never as a rewrite
   of a cut one.

## 3. Validation

A descriptor is valid iff: it declares `format`; validation runs against the declared version's
rules (§2 for format 1); `version`, `title`, `basis`, and `summary` are present and well-formed;
the filename agrees with `version`; and every `basis` ID resolves. `scripts/validate-releases.py`
implements this and runs on every pull request touching `releases/`.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for a cut. CI additionally requires, at the commit under
release, that the tag does not already exist, that the target is an ancestor of the default branch,
and that every canon gate in `CLAUDE.md` passes — ordering and transclusion, claim and decision
schema, and reproduction of every `core/assets/` computation. A valid descriptor whose gates fail
is not cut, and leaves no tag behind.

## 4. Why the descriptor and not the tag (note)

Interpretation note, not a rule. The tag is the artifact; the descriptor is the decision that
produced it. Filing the decision as a reviewable file, with a principal (the pull request's author
and approver) and `basis` edges to the claims it rests on, is the ontology's own treatment of
decisions applied to this repository's releases — a release cut by an unreviewed command is an
escaped decision about which canon the world sees.
